## Why choose Obsidian
1. Local Storage & Privacy

	•	Obsidian stores all your notes as plain text Markdown files on your local machine. This means your data is entirely in your control, with no dependence on cloud services unless you choose to sync it yourself.
	•	It offers privacy by default, as none of your data is shared with external servers unless explicitly set up.

2. Markdown-Based

	•	Obsidian uses the Markdown format, which is lightweight and widely supported. It’s a simple, human-readable format that can easily be exported, transferred, or integrated with other platforms.
	•	Markdown files also mean that your notes are future-proof — you’re not locked into proprietary formats.

3. Bidirectional Linking

	•	One of Obsidian’s most powerful features is its bidirectional linking. You can easily link notes together, and see all notes that link back to the current note, helping you create a network of interrelated ideas.
	•	This creates a knowledge graph that helps surface connections between ideas, fostering serendipitous discovery of related content.

4. Graph View

	•	The graph view provides a visual representation of your notes and their connections. You can see how ideas are linked together in real-time, making it easier to explore relationships between your notes.
	•	This can be especially useful for researchers, students, or anyone managing complex topics, as it turns your notes into a dynamic mind map.

5. Highly Customizable

	•	Obsidian offers a variety of themes, plugins, and community add-ons that allow you to tailor the tool to your exact needs. Whether it’s customizing your writing environment or adding new functionalities, Obsidian is highly extendable.
	•	You can install plugins for features like task management, flashcards, calendar integration, or even integrate with code snippets for programming tasks.

6. Offline-First

	•	Since Obsidian works with local files, you don’t need an internet connection to access or manage your notes. Everything is available offline, making it perfect for writing and note-taking in areas with limited connectivity.

7. Speed and Efficiency

	•	Obsidian is lightweight and fast, able to handle large collections of notes without slowing down. It’s a performance-oriented tool designed to scale well with your growing knowledge base.
	•	With the help of hotkeys and a command palette, users can easily navigate through notes and perform actions quickly.

8. Community Support

	•	Obsidian has an active and thriving community that develops plugins, creates tutorials, and shares best practices for personal knowledge management. You’ll find lots of community-generated resources to help you get more from the app.

9. Cross-Platform Availability

	•	Obsidian runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, meaning you can access your notes across devices seamlessly. Obsidian Sync (optional paid service) provides encrypted synchronization between devices for users who want automatic backups and cross-device sync.

10. Non-Linear Organization

	•	Unlike linear or folder-based systems, Obsidian encourages non-linear note-taking. It’s easy to create connections between notes in any direction, making it ideal for complex, interrelated ideas like research, journaling, or long-term knowledge development.

11. Free for Personal Use

	•	Obsidian is free for personal use, making it accessible to a broad audience. Paid features like Obsidian Sync or Obsidian Publish are optional and suited for users with specific needs like cloud synchronization or web publishing.
